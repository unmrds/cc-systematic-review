# Introduction to Systematic Reviews

## Objectives

- Describe what a systematic review is
- Compare systematic reviews to other types of review articles
- Describe reasons for performing systematic reviews
- Describe the process of a systematic review
- Describe the role of team members in a systematic review

## Definitions

### Systematic Review: 

A process of collecting and synthesizing evidence to answer a specific question using a pre-specified protocol

### Meta-Analysis: 

A method of statistically pooling the results of individual studies

## Visual Clues

Systematic reviews usually have [flow diagrams](http://prisma-statement.org/prismastatement/flowdiagram.aspx)

Meta-analyses often have [forest plots](https://s4be.cochrane.org/blog/2016/07/11/tutorial-read-forest-plot/)

## Systematic Review vs. Traditional Review

### Systematic Review:

- **Question:** Narrow, specific; usually based on a PICO question (in health sciences)
- **Purpose:** Decision-making guidance
- **Protocol:** Yes
- **Search:** Rigorous, sensitive, and documented
- **Reproducible:** Yes
- **Number of individuals needed:** Min: 3; Typically 5-8
- **Bias and error protection:** Yes
- **Time needed:** 18 months average

### Traditional Review:

- **Question:** Broad  
- **Purpose:** Keeping up to date, learning about a broad topic
- **Protocol:** No
- **Search:** Maybe
- **Reproducible:** No
- **Number of individuals needed:** 1
- **Bias and error protection:** No
- **Time needed:** Depends on topic, expertise

## Other Terms
	
### Systematic review family: 

Rapid review, network meta-analysis, scoping review, metanarrative review, realist review, evidence map, umbrella review, review of reviews, rapid evidence assessment, mixed methods review, health technology assessment

### Traditional review family: 

Expert review, clinical case review, narrative review, critical review, literature review, overview, state of the art review, expert commentary

**What distinguishe[s] systematic reviews [i]s the use of formal explicit methods**

DOI: [10.1186/s13643-015-0163-7](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-015-0163-7)* 

## Why a Systematic Review?

Reduce Bias, Enhance Transparency

## Sources of Bias

- [Reporting Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporting_bias)
  - Publication bias 
  - Selective outcome reporting bias
  - Time-lag bias
  - Location bias
  - Language bias
  - Multiple/duplication publication bias
  - Citation bias
- [Cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)
  - Anchoring
  - Confirmation bias
  - Expectation bias
  - Observer-expectancy effect
  - Semmelweis reflex
- [Social bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Social)
  - Authority bias
  - Ingroup bias

# The Hows

## Prep Work

- Read some systematic reviews to familiarize yourself with structure, components
	- **[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/reviews)** (health sciences focus; UNM only)
	- **[Campbell Systematic Reviews](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/18911803)** (social sciences focus; UNM only)
	- ***[Systematic Reviews](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/)*** (health sciences focus; journal; open access) 
- Read the [PRISMA Statement](http://prisma-statement.org/)

## The General Process:

Items in **bold** can be done using tools in [Covidence](https://app.covidence.org); starred items will be the focus of our hands-on practice. Items in *italics* will not be discussed, as they are only relevant for a systematic review with meta-analysis

1. Develop an answerable question
2. Develop a protocol with pre-specified eligibility criteria
3. *Develop a priori hypotheses to explain inconsistency* (systematic review with meta-analysis only)
4. Conduct search
5. **Screen abstracts***
6. **Screen full text***
7. **Extract data**
8. **Assess risk of bias**
9. Describe outcomes/data
10. *Combine effect sizes* (systematic review with meta-analysis only)
11. *Try to explain heterogeneity* (systematic review with meta-analysis only)
12. *Rate confidence in estimates* (systematic review with meta-analysis only)


## Assemble the Team

**Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are team science**

Team members:

- Topic expert(s) 
- Librarian 
- Statistician

Also consider:

- Screeners and Extractors (students, trainees)
- Systematic Review Methodologist (can be filled by experienced Librarian/Statistician)

## Develop a Protocol

What needs to be in a protocol?

- Question and rationale
- **Full eligibility criteria** (inclusion / exclusion criteria)
    - All criteria for inclusion should be met (logical AND)
    - Any criterion for exclusion leads to exclusion (logical OR)
- All information sources, plus draft of at least one search strategy
- Process for screening and extraction
- Process for assessing risk of bias
- Methods for synthesizing data, explaining heterogeneity

**Resources for Protocols**

> **DISCUSSION**: In the [Moriarty et al article](https://libkey.io/libraries/2623/articles/54369214/full-text-file?utm_source=nomad), what did they do for each component? 

## Conduct the Search

Each information resource and search strategy plan unique

## Search Design

- Must be sensitive
- Use controlled vocabulary and free text
- Synonyms
- All languages
- No limits
- Can use validated filters
- Must be reproducible
- Documentation critical
- Grey Lit documentation
	- [CADTH Grey Matters](https://www.cadth.ca/resources/finding-evidence/grey-matters)
- Include a librarian on the team
